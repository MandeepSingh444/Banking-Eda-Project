# Banking-Eda-Project

Overview: 
Downloaded a banking dataset in CSV format and imported it into a MySQL database. 
Connected MySQL to Jupyter Notebook using Python (via MySQL connector). Queried the data directly from MySQL into Pandas for analysis. 
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Used visualizations (like bar charts, countplot and heatmaps) to explore relationships between different columns.
Analyzed how different account balances are related to each other.

Key Insight: 
I found that customers who have high balances in one type of account such as Checking, Savings, or Foreign Currency Accounts often tend to have high balances in the other account types as well. 
This strong positive correlation between Bank Deposits and multiple account types suggests that customers with more funds usually spread their money across different types of accounts
